# CountTheRice_OpenCV
In this Project Solve the Problem To Count the Rice (Both Broken And Unbroken) and Also Count the Percentage Of Broken Rice 
Pixels in an image can take a large range of values, even the ones representing same or similar objects. This poses particular hurdles to solving image understanding tasks using classical computer vision algorithm steps. In our input grayscale image the values represent various shades of grey ranging from 0 to 255 of the 8-bit image representation. The boundaries of values separating one type of object from another are not always clear and may have significant range overlap due to lighting conditions during the image acquisition. The standard approach is to reduce the values to a handful of distinct values, each representing meaningful objects. This is known as segmentation. In this case, we only have two types of regions within the image. One is the group of pixels belonging to the rice grains, and the other belonging to the background void. This is a very common special case known as Binary Segmentation i.e., transform the input grayscale image into a pure black and white form. Pure white depicting the pixels of the rice grains and pure black depicting the universal background. Once this is done, the problem boils down to merely counting the number of distinct pure white objects in the image. There are a number of differing ways to achieve the above.
